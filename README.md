# EIT
These codes are used to calculate the Electromagnetically induced transparency.
File "General EIT" is used to calculate the general EIT, with relaxation terms described by Lindblad terms.
File "EIT(low temperature)" is used to calculate the low temperature NV EIT, with phenomenological relaxation terms.
File "Eigenstates" is used to calculate the eigenstates of room temperature NV excited states in the presence of hyperfine interaction.
File "9-level Model" is used to calculate the nuclear spin polarization using the 9-level model.
File "21-level Model" is used to calculate the nuclear spin polarization using the 21-level model.
